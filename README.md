# Fake Review Detection System

Reviews offer a great way to help guide one's search for a specific product. However, many online product pages contain fake reviews, which can make it harder to for consumers to decide whether or not to make a purchase. This project attempts to address this issue by detecting fake reviews using artificial intelligence. By using a labelled review dataset and a multilayer convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), fake reviews are detected with 90.0% accuracy. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a browser extension to identify fake reviews using a neural network trained on fake review data.
